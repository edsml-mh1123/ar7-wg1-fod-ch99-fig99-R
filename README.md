## Description

The periods covered are 0â€“450 Ma (a), 0â€“58 Ma (b), and 0â€“3500 ka (c), reconstructed from continental rock, marine sediment and ice core records. Note different time scales and axes ranges in panels (a), (b) and (c). Dark and light green bands in (a) are uncertainty envelopes at 68% and 95% uncertainty, respectively. 100 ppm in each panel is shown by the marker in the lower right-hand corner to aid comparison between panels. In panel (b) and (c) the major paleoclimate reference periods (CCB2.1) have been labelled, and in addition: MPT (Mid Pleistocene Transition), MCO (Miocene Climatic Optimum). Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 2.SM.1).
